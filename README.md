# Crop-Yield-Prediction
Agriculture is the backbone of Indian economy. Farming is a highly difficult and demanding occupation. Due to a variety of causes, farmers in our nation endure great challenges. Lack of knowledge or inaccurate information is the major cause of their suffering. By ensuring that our cultivators receive more sophisticated information about the best crop that can be harvested to ensure maximum yield by taking into account factors like humidity, rainfall, soil nutrition, and precipitation levels in their locality, the agriculture sector in our nation could be significantly strengthened. We can provide farmers the most accurate forecasts and recommendations via the use of contemporary machine learning algorithms, enabling them to generate high-quality yields and enjoy the profits.
To develop and improve the accuracy of crop yield prediction by using different machine  learning and deep learning algorithms.
